### Run an array of functions in parallel

### install

```
npm install run-parallel
```

### usage

#### parallel(tasks, [callback])

Run the `tasks` array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous
function has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its callback, the main
`callback` is immediately called with the value of the error. Once the `tasks` have
completed, the results are passed to the final `callback` as an array.

It is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be run as a
function and the results will be passed to the final `callback` as an object instead of
an array. This can be a more readable way of handling the results.

##### arguments

- `tasks` - An array or object containing functions to run. Each function is passed a
`callback(err, result)` which it must call on
